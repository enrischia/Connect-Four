# Connect-Four
This study explores neural network models replicating moves of a pre-trained AI in Connect Four. Data is processed by removing duplicates and preprocessing for machine learning. Two architectures are compared: fully connected layers and convolutional layers. Models are analyzed using performance metrics and confusion matrices
